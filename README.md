## Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **HTML (`index.html`):**

   - Defines the structure of the Simon Says game, including the game title, colored tiles, start button, and information section.
   - Embeds the necessary audio elements for each colored tile.

2. **CSS (`style.css`):**

   - Provides styling for the game elements, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface.
   - Defines tile colors, hover effects, and styles for the start button and information section.

3. **JavaScript (`main.js`):**
   - Implements the game logic, including the generation of sequences, handling player input, and managing game rounds.
   - Integrates with the HTML and CSS to create an interactive gaming experience.

## Files

- **HTML (`index.html`):**

  - Sets up the HTML structure for the Simon Says game.
  - Links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for logic.

- **CSS (`style.css`):**

  - Defines styles for the game components, including colored tiles, start button, and information section.
  - Implements responsive design with a media query for smaller screens.

- **JavaScript (`main.js`):**
